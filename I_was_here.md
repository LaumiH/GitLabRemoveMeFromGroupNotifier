## Hi there!

I - the issuer of this commit - have asked to get removed from the *<group>* GitLab group like three times now. 
The first time was a year ago.
As you can read this message, I am still able to commit to this group's projects.

In my opinion, programmers are allowed to program a mild prank when they want to leave a GitLab group they cannot leave themselves, and are ignored for such a long time.

Therefore, I have added this file in a new branch in every project I can access in the <group> GitLab group (and subgroups).
I also opened a merge request for this branch in every project.

This causes no harm and hopefully has the desired effect: I finally get removed from the group, 
and its admins take a little more care about who actually is a member. 
Imagine what else I could have programmed :)

In case you don't want to delete the merge requests and branches by hand, 
you can download the script from [LaumiH's repo](https://github.com/LaumiH/GitLabRemoveMeFromGroupNotifier) and run it using `python3 de-prank.py -group <group> -name <name>`. 
It is well documented so that non-Python speaking people comprehend that it really does nothing apart from deleting the merge requests and branches.
